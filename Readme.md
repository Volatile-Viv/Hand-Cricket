# Hand Cricket Game

This project is a Python implementation of the popular game Hand Cricket, often played in schools during class hours. It was created by Vivek Kumar and is available for educational purposes only.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply run the `hand_cricket.py` file in a Python environment. The game will guide you through the rules and options.

## How to Play

Hand Cricket is a simple game played between two players, typically using hands to represent the scores. The objective of the game is to score as many runs as possible before getting out.

The game is played in rounds, with one player acting as the batsman and the other as the bowler. The batsman chooses a number between 1 and 6, and the bowler chooses a number at the same time. If the numbers match, the batsman is out. Otherwise, the runs scored by the batsman are added to their score, and the players switch roles for the next round.

The game continues until the batsman is out, at which point the roles are reversed and the second player gets a chance to bat. The winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.
